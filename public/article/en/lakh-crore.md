In the Indian numbering system, numbers are grouped in steps of two digits instead of the familiar three (00 instead of 000):
- 1,00,000 = 1 lakh (one hundred thousand)
- 10,00,000 = 10 lakh (one million)
- 1,00,00,000 = 1 crore (ten million)
- 10,00,00,000 = 10 crore (one hundred million)

Although fractional steps also exist (thousand - hazar, billion - arab), Indians prefer to use only lakh and crore.

For example, on this poster: 3 lakh crore, that is "three times one hundred thousand times ten million":
